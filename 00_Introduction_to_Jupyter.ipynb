    "Notebook documents (or “notebooks”, all lower case) are documents produced by the Jupyter Notebook App, which contain both *computer code* (e.g. python) and *rich text elements* (paragraph, equations, figures, links, etc...). Notebook documents are both human-readable documents containing the analysis description and the results (figures, tables, etc..) as well as executable documents which can be run to perform data analysis."
